# What is tmux?
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer an alternative to GNU Screen . In other words, it means that you can start a Tmux session and then open multiple windows inside that session. Each window occupies the entire screen and can be split into rectangular panes.
With Tmux you can easily switch between multiple programs in one terminal, detach them and reattach them to a different terminal.
# Installing Tmux
Install Tmux with command: `sudo apt install tmux`
# Start your first Tmux Session
To start Tmux session simply type: `tmux` in your console  
This will open a new session, create a new window, and start a shell in that window.  
Once you are in Tmux youâ€™ll notice a status line at the bottom of the screen which shows information about the current session  
You can now run your first Tmux command. For example, to get a list of all commands, you would type:  
`Ctrl+b` `?`  
# Creating Named Tmux Sessions
By default, Tmux sessions are named numerically. Named sessions are useful when you run multiple Tmux sessions. 
To create a new named session, run the tmux command with the following arguments:  
`tmux new -s session_name`
# Detaching from Tmux Session
You can detach from the Tmux session and return to your normal shell by typing:  
` Ctrl+b` `d`
# Re-attaching to Tmux Session
To attach to a session first, you need to find the name of the session. To get a list of the currently running sessions type:  
`tmux ls`  
The name of the session is the first column of the output.

As you can see from the output, there are two running Tmux sessions.  
For example, to attach to session 0, you would type:  
`tmux attach-session -t 0`  
# Working with Tmux Windows and Panes
When you start a new Tmux session, by default, it creates a single window with a shell in it.  
To create a new window with shell type  
`ctrl+b` `c`  the first available number from the range 0...9 will be assigned to it.  
A list of all windows is shown on the status line at the bottom of the screen.
Below are some most common commands for managing Tmux windows and panes:
- `Ctrl+b` `c` Create a new window (with shell)
- `Ctrl+b` `w` Choose window from a list
- `Ctrl+b` `0` Switch to window 0 (by number )
- `Ctrl+b` `,` Rename the current window
- `Ctrl+b` `%` Split current pane horizontally into two panes
- `Ctrl+b` `"` Split current pane vertically into two panes
- `Ctrl+b` `o` Go to the next pane
- `Ctrl+b` `;` Toggle between the current and previous pane
- `Ctrl+b` `x` Close the current pane
